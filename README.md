# PANDAS-Challenge
Create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyse school and standardised test data.

ðŸ“‹ Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your local government area. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. You'll be given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

ðŸ“Š The report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data and the following data:

Local Government Area (LGA) Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the local government area's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:

âœ” Total number of unique schools

Total students

Total budget

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

Note: A passing grade is 50 or higher.

âœ” School Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school.

Include the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

âœ” Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

âœ” Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

âœ” Maths Scores by Year
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average maths score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

âœ” Reading Scores by Year
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

âœ” Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

âœ” Scores by School Size

âœ” Scores by School Type
